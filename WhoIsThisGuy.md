## 👋 Hello, I'm Burak from Türkiye

I am a game developer focused on Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, with a strong interest in building clean, scalable, and well-structured game systems.

I have been actively developing with **Unreal Engine 5 for over 2 years**, working on gameplay mechanics, systems, and technical problem-solving. Alongside UE5, I continue to improve my skills in **Unity**, **C++**, **C#**, and **Blender**, with a long-term goal of working in Japan as a professional game developer.

I value teamwork, clear communication, and responsibility. I adapt well to structured development environments and enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams such as designers, artists, and programmers.
